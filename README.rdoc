Just a quick app to show what I learned using geocoder.  For full documentation, see here:

It appears you need to create a geocoder controller and make a geocoder method in it.

In the rails console, make a Locator object by inputting any address and save it.  Then do Locator.near() with the first param being coordinates as an array of two floats or an address as a string, and second param is the number of miles (this can be changed to km in initializers/geocoder.rb).  It will return the entry from your db if it's within range.
